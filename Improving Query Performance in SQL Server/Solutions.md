Formatting - player BMI
In this exercise, you are working with a team on a data analytics project, which has been asked to provide some statistics on NBA players to a health care company. You want to create a query that returns the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each player from North America.

BMI=weight(kg)height(cm)2
A colleague has passed you a query he was working on:

select PlayerName, Country,
round(Weight_kg/SQUARE(Height_cm/100),2) BMI 
from Players Where Country = 'USA' 
Or Country = 'Canada'
order by BMI
To make some sense of the code, you want to structure and format it in a way that is consistent and easy to read.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Change all SQL syntax (clauses, operators, and functions) to UPPERCASE.
Make sure all SQL syntax begins on a new line.
Add an indent to the calculated BMI column and OR statement.


select PlayerName, Country,
round(Weight_kg/SQUARE(Height_cm/100),2) BMI
from Players Where Country = 'USA'
Or Country = 'Canada'
order by BMI;



Commenting - player BMI
Adding comments is a good way to convey what the query is about or information about certain parts of the query.

The sample code is a query on the Players table that returns player name, country of origin and a calculated Body Mass Index (BMI). The WHERE condition is filtering for only players from North America.

You will add the following comment.

Returns the Body Mass Index (BMI) for all North American players from the 2017-2018 NBA season

Also, you believe that ORDER BY is unnecessary in this query so it will be commented out and a comment added on the same line indicating it is not required.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Create a comment block on lines 1 and 4.
Add the above comment to the block.
Comment out the ORDER BY statement and add Order by not required comment on the same line.
Add ; directly after 'Canada' to indicate the new ending of the query.


SELECT PlayerName, Country,
    ROUND(Weight_kg/SQUARE(Height_cm/100),2) BMI 
FROM Players 
WHERE Country = 'USA'
    OR Country = 'Canada'
ORDER BY BMI;



Commenting - how many Kiwis in the NBA?
You and a friend would like to know how many New Zealanders (affectionately known as Kiwis) play in the NBA. Your friend attempts to write a query, but it is not very well formatted and contains several errors. You re-write the query, but you want to keep his original for comparison and future reference.

This exercise requires you to create line comments and comment out blocks of code

Remove the block comment syntax from your query on lines 15 and 23.

-- Your friend's query
-- First attempt, contains errors and inconsistent formatting
/*
select PlayerName, p.Country,sum(ps.TotalPoints) 
AS TotalPoints  
FROM PlayerStats ps inner join Players On ps.PlayerName = p.PlayerName
WHERE p.Country = 'New Zeeland'

order by Country;
*/

-- Your query
-- Second attempt - errors corrected and formatting fixed

SELECT p.PlayerName, p.Country,
	   SUM(ps.TotalPoints) AS TotalPoints  
FROM PlayerStats ps 
INNER JOIN Players p
	ON ps.PlayerName = p.PlayerName
WHERE p.Country = 'New Zealand'
GROUP BY p.PlayerName, p.Country;



Ambiguous column names
When joining tables, we use aliases in the SELECT statement to indicate the source tables of the selected columns, with each column name prefixed with the table name alias.

The following query joins the Players and PlayerStats tables to return total points by PlayerName and Country for all players from Australia.

SELECT PlayerName, p.Country,
         SUM(ps.TotalPoints) AS TotalPoints  
FROM PlayerStats ps
INNER JOIN Players p
   ON ps.PlayerName = p.PlayerName
WHERE p.Country = 'Australia'
GROUP BY p.PlayerName, p.Country
Copy and paste the query into the console and select Run Code to view the results. The query returns an error which includes the words ... Ambiguous column name...

Fix the query and run it. What was wrong with the original query?

Possible Answers
The INNER JOIN must also reference the Country column.
PlayerName is in both the Players and PlayerStats tables. It requires an alias prefix.
An alias cannot be the same name as the aggregated column, i.e. TotalPoints.
WHERE cannot process Australia because there are no Australians are in the NBA.

Aliasing - team BMI
A basketball statistician would like to know the average Body Mass Index (BMI) per NBA team, in particular, any team with an average BMI of 25 or more. To include Team in the query, you will need to join the Players table to the PlayerStats table. The query will require aliasing to:

Easily identify joined tables and associated columns.
Identify sub-queries.
Avoid ambiguity in column names.
Identify new columns.

SELECT Team, 
   ROUND(AVG(BMI),2) AS AvgTeamBMI -- Alias the new column
FROM PlayerStats AS ps -- Alias PlayerStats table
INNER JOIN

Syntax order - New Zealand earthquakes
When executing a query, the processing order of the main SQL syntax is different from the written order in the query.

You want a simple query that returns all the recorded earthquakes in New Zealand that had a magnitude of 7.5 or higher. You think the query out in a sentence before creating it.

From the Earthquakes table, filter for only rows where Country equals 'NZ' and Magnitude greater than or equal to 7.5. Then, select the columns Date, Place, NearestPop, and Magnitude. Order the final results from the largest Magnitude to the smallest Magnitude.

The sample code is arranged in the order that matches the above sentence, which is the same as the SQL syntax processing order in the database. You will need to reorder it so that it runs without error.

Syntax order - Japan earthquakes
Your friend is impressed by your querying skills. She decides to create a query on her own that shows all earthquakes in Japan that were a magnitude of 8 or higher. She has constructed a query based on how she thought about what she requires. Her query will produce an error because of the incorrect ordering of the syntax. Also, the code requires reformatting to make it easy to read.

FROM Earthquakes WHERE Country = 'JP' AND Magnitude >= 8 SELECT Date, Place ,NearestPop, Magnitude ORDER BY Magnitude DESC;

You will fix the query for her with a better coding format and correct the SQL syntax order.

Syntax order - very large earthquakes
When a query is executed it will stop at the first error it encounters and will return an error message. Because a query is processed in a stepped order the first error it stops at will be related to the processing order.

FROM is processed first and checks that the queried table(s) exist in the database.
WHERE is always processed after FROM if a row filtering condition is specified. Column(s) having the filtering condition applied must exist.
SELECT is only processed once the data is ready to be extracted and displayed or returned to the user.
This exercise has three queriesâ€”each contains errors. Your job is to find the errors and fix them.

Column does not exist
When using WHERE as a filter condition, it is important to think about the processing order in the query. In this exercise, you want a query that returns NBA players with average total rebounds of 12 or more per game. The following formula calculates average total rebounds from the PlayerStats table;

AverageTotalRebounds=(DefensiveRebounds+OffensiveRebounds)GamesPlayed
The first query in Step 1 returns an error. Select Run Code to view the error. The second query, in Step 2, will give you the results you want, without error, by using a sub-query.

Note that GamesPlayed is CAST AS numeric to ensure we get decimal points in our output, as opposed to whole numbers.

Functions in WHERE
You want to know which players from the 2017-2018 NBA season went to college in Louisiana. You ask a friend to make the query for you.

Row filtering with HAVING
In some cases, using HAVING, instead of WHERE, as a filter condition will produce the same results. If filtering individual or ungrouped rows then it is more efficient to use WHERE.

Copy the following query to the console and select Run Code to view the results. Why should HAVING not be used as a filter condition in this query?
SELECT Country, COUNT(*) CountOfPlayers 
FROM Players
GROUP BY Country
HAVING Country 
    IN ('Argentina','Brazil','Dominican Republic'
        ,'Puerto Rico');
Possible Answers
An aggregate function must enclose the Country column in the HAVING filter.
The filter is on individual rows. Using HAVING here, for filtering, could increase the time a query takes to run.
The query returns an error because HAVING is processed before GROUP BY.
If a query is using HAVING for filtering it must also use WHERE.

Add the WHERE filter condition.
Fill in the missing two Latin American countries in the IN statement.

SELECT Country, COUNT(*) CountOfPlayers
FROM Players
-- Add the filter condition
WHERE Country
-- Fill in the missing countries
	IN ('Argentina','Brazil','Dominican Republic'
        ,'Puerto Rico')
GROUP BY Country;



Filtering with WHERE and HAVING
WHERE and HAVING can be used as filters in the same query. But how we use them, where we use them and what we use them for is quite different.

You want a query that returns the total points contribution of a teams Power Forwards where their total points contribution is greater than 3000.

Instructions
100 XP
Apply a filter condition for only rows where position equals Power Forward (PF).
Apply a grouped row filter for total points greater than 3000.

SELECT Team, 
	SUM(TotalPoints) AS TotalPFPoints
FROM PlayerStats
-- Filter for only rows with power forwards
WHERE Position = 'PF'
GROUP BY Team
-- Filter for total points greater than 3000
HAVING SUM(TotalPoints) > 3000;



Test your knowledge of HAVING
The following query from the NBA Season 2017-2018 database returns the total points contribution, of a teams Centers, where total points are greater than 2500.

SELECT Team, 
    SUM(TotalPoints) AS TotalCPoints
FROM PlayerStats
WHERE Position = 'C'
GROUP BY Team
HAVING SUM(TotalPoints) > 2500;

When filtering a numeric column, HAVING must be used with an aggregate function, for example: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()...
WHERE and HAVING can be used in the same query.
Use HAVING with, and after, GROUP BY.
HAVING and WHERE produce the same output, so it doesn't matter which one you use.

Remove duplicates with DISTINCT()
You want to know the closest city to earthquakes with a magnitude of 8 or higher. You can get this information from the Earthquakes table. However, a simple query returns duplicate rows because some cities have experienced more than one magnitude 8 or higher earthquake.

You can remove duplicates by using the DISTINCT() clause. Once you have your results, you would like to know how many times each city has experienced an earthquake of magnitude 8 or higher.

Note that IS NOT NULL is being used because many earthquakes do not occur near any populated area, thankfully.

SELECT DISTINCT(NearestPop),-- Remove duplicate city
		Country
FROM Earthquakes
WHERE Magnitude >= 8 -- Add filter condition
	AND NearestPop IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY NearestPop;  


Get the number of cities near earthquakes of magnitude 8 or more.

FROM Earthquakes
WHERE Magnitude >= 8
	AND Country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY NearestPop, Country -- Group columns
ORDER BY NumEarthquakes DESC;



UNION and UNION ALL
You want a query that returns all cities listed in the Earthquakes database. It should be an easy query on the Cities table. However, to be sure you get all cities in the database you will append the query to the Nations table to include capital cities as well. You will use UNION to remove any duplicate rows.

Out of curiosity, you want to know if there were any duplicate rows. If you do the same query but append with UNION ALL instead, and compare the number of rows returned in each query, UNION ALL will return more rows if there are duplicates.

Question
Which of the following is true concerning using UNION ALL and UNION on the queries in Step 1 and Step 2. Run the code in the console and experiment appending queries with UNION and UNION ALL.

Possible Answers
Using UNION and UNION ALL returns the same number of rows.
From looking at the tables, I would not expect any duplicate rows with UNION ALL.
More rows are returned with UNION ALL therefore, UNION must be removing duplicates.
More rows are returned with UNION therefore, UNION must be adding duplicates.

Sub-query vs INNER JOIN
Often the results from a correlated sub-query can be replicated using an INNER JOIN. Depending on what your requirements are, using an INNER JOIN may be more efficient because it only makes one pass through the data whereas the correlated sub-query must execute for each row in the outer query.

You want to find out the 2017 population of the biggest city for every country in the world. You can get this information from the Earthquakes database with the Nations table as the outer query and Cities table in the sub-query.

You will first create this query as a correlated sub-query then rewrite it using an INNER JOIN.

INTERSECT
INTERSECT is one of the easier and more intuitive methods used to check if data in one table is present in another.

You want to know which, if any, country capitals are listed as the nearest city to recorded earthquakes. You can get this information by comparing the Nations table with the Earthquakes table.

INTERSECT -- Add the operator to compare the two queries

SELECT NearestPop -- Add the city name column
FROM Earthquakes;


EXCEPT
EXCEPT does the opposite of INTERSECT. It is used to check if data, present in one table, is absent in another.

You want to know which countries have no recorded earthquakes. You can get this information by comparing the Nations table with the Earthquakes table.

SELECT Country 
FROM Earthquakes; -- Table with capital cities



Interrogating with INTERSECT
INTERSECT and EXCEPT are very useful for data interrogation.

The Earthquakes and NBA Season 2017-2018 databases both contain information on countries and cities. You are interested to know which countries are represented by players in the 2017-2018 NBA season and you believe you can get the results you require by querying the relevant tables across these two databases.

Use the INTERSECT operator between queries, but be careful and think about the results. Although both tables contain a country name column to compare, these are separate databases and the data may be stored differently.

Select Run Code to view the results.
Repeat steps 1 to 4 for the other query.
SELECT *

WHERE Country LIKE 'U%'
Possible Answers
The outer query should be using the Code3 column from the Nations table, not CountryName.
The values do not match. In the Nations table, the value for country name is stored as United States of America, and in the Players table, the value is stored as USA.
The original query contains filters on the Nations and Players tables for countries other than the USA.
INTERSECT is not the correct operator to use. The correct operator to use for this question is EXCEPT.

IN and EXISTS
You want to know which, if any, country capitals are listed as the nearest city to recorded earthquakes. You can get this information using INTERSECT and comparing the Nations table with the Earthquakes table.

NOT IN and NOT EXISTS
NOT IN and NOT EXISTS do the opposite of IN and EXISTS respectively. They are used to check if the data present in one table is absent in another.

You are interested to know if there are some countries in the Nations table that do not appear in the Cities table. There may be many reasons for this. For example, all the city populations from a country may be too small to be listed, or there may be no city data for a particular country at the time the data was compiled.

You will compare the queries using country codes.

NOT IN with IS NOT NULL
You want to know which country capitals have never been the closest city to recorded earthquakes. You decide to use NOT IN to compare Capital from the Nations table, in the outer query, with NearestPop, from the Earthquakes table, in a sub-query.

Add the country capital name column to the outer query.
Add the city name column to the sub-query.
Check how many rows the query returns. Does this mean that earthquakes have been recorded near every capital city in the world?

SELECT WorldBankRegion,
       CountryName,
       Capital -- Capital city name column
FROM Nations
WHERE Capital NOT IN
	(SELECT NearestPop -- City name column
	 FROM Earthquakes);


The column in the SELECT statement of the sub-query contains NULL values and will require a filter to remove the NULL values from the query.

Add the WHERE filter condition to the sub-query to get the query working correctly.

SELECT WorldBankRegion,
       CountryName,
       Capital
FROM Nations
WHERE Capital NOT IN
	(SELECT NearestPop
     FROM Earthquakes
     WHERE NearestPop IS NOT NULL); -- filter condition



INNER JOIN
An insurance company that specializes in sports franchises has asked you to assess the geological hazards of cities hosting NBA teams. You believe you can get this information by querying the Teams and Earthquakes tables across the Earthquakes and NBA Season 2017-2018 databases respectively. Your initial query will use EXISTS to compare tables. The second query will use a more appropriate operator.

Instructions 1/3
1 XP
Add the table for the outer query.
Add the operator to compare the outer query with the sub-query.
Add the table for the sub-query.
Check the results. Only columns from the Teams table are returned.

-- Initial query
SELECT TeamName,
       TeamCode,
	   City
FROM Teams AS t -- Add table
WHERE EXISTS -- Operator to compare queries
      (SELECT 1 
	  FROM Earthquakes AS e -- Add table
	  WHERE t.City = e.NearestPop);


Something doesn't look right. You'll need columns from the Earthquakes and Teams tables to makes sense of the results.

Add the place description and country code where the earthquake occurred.
Add the operator to compare the tables.

-- Second query
SELECT t.TeamName,
       t.TeamCode,
	   t.City,
	   e.Date,
	   e.Place, -- Place description
	   e.Country -- Country code
FROM Teams AS t
INNER JOIN Earthquakes AS e -- Operator to compare tables
	  ON t.City = e.NearestPop


Question
In this exercise, what does the INNER JOIN help you to determine that EXISTS could not?

Possible Answers
Queries that use EXISTS are slower than queries that use INNER JOIN.
The INNER JOIN returned two rows, so there must be duplicate rows in the Teams table.
The NBA team based in San Antonio, USA has a high risk of earthquake hazards.
The earthquakes occurred in San Antonio, Chile, not San Antonio, USA.

Exclusive LEFT OUTER JOIN
An exclusive LEFT OUTER JOIN can be used to check for the presence of data in one table that is absent in another table. To create an exclusive LEFT OUTER JOIN the right query requires an IS NULL filter condition on the joining column.

STATISTICS TIME in queries
A friend is writing a training course on how the command STATISTICS TIME can be used to tune query performance and asks for your help to complete a presentation. He requires two queries that return NBA team details where the host city had a 2017 population of more than two million.

NBA team details can be queried from the NBA Season 2017-2018 database and city populations can be queried by adding in tables from the Earthquakes database.

Each query uses a different filter on the Teams table.

Query 1

Filters the Teams table using IN and three sub-queries
Query 2

Filters the Teams table using EXISTS

For Query 1:

Add the filter operator for each sub-query.
Add the table from the Earthquakes database to the first query.

-- Query 1
SELECT * 
FROM Teams
-- Sub-query 1
WHERE City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
      (SELECT CityName 
       FROM Cities) -- Table from Earthquakes database
-- Sub-query 2
   AND City IN -- Sub-query filter operator

    AND City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
        (SELECT CityName 
         FROM Cities
	     WHERE Pop2017 >2000000);


For Query 2

Add the filter operator for the sub-query.
Add the two city name columns being compared to the sub-query.


-- Query 2
SELECT * 
FROM Teams AS t
WHERE EXISTS -- Sub-query filter operator
	(SELECT 1 
     FROM Cities AS c
     WHERE t.City = c.CityName -- Columns being compared

STATISTICS IO: Example 1
Your sales company has just taken on a new regional manager for Western Europe. He has asked you to provide him daily updates on orders shipped to some key Western Europe capital cities. As this data is time sensitive, you want a robust query that is tuned to return the results as quickly as possible.

You initially decide on a query that uses two sub-queries: one in the SELECT statement to get the count of orders and one using a filter condition with an IN operator.

You will turn on the STATISTICS IO command to review the page read statistics.

Question
For these two queries, what conclusion could you make using the following output from the STATISTICS IO command?

Query 1

4694 results returned
Table 'Cities'. ..., logical reads 274, ... ,
Query 2

212 results returned
Table 'Cities'. ..., logical reads 10, ... ,
Possible Answers
Query 1 accesses a clustered index because proportionally there were fewer logical reads for results returned.
The filter conditions are different; therefore it is not possible to tell which query is accessing a clustered index. The number of rows returned needs to be the same to make the comparison.
Query 2 accesses a clustered index because logical reads indicates fewer data pages were accessed compared to Query 1
Results returned versus logical reads are proportionally similar, so there is no way to tell which query is accessing a clustered index.

Sort operator in execution plans
Execution plans can tell us if and where a query used an internal sorting operation. Internal sorting is often required when using an operator in a query that checks for and removes duplicate rows.

You are given an execution plan of a query that returns all cities listed in the Earthquakes database. The query appends queries from the Nations and Cities tables. Use the following execution plan to determine if the appending operator used is UNION or UNION ALL
